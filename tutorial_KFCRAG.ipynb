He studied painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Tehran, from 1996 to 2003. In 2004 he moved to Paris, where he continued his artistic studies at the École des Beaux-Arts de Paris, under the supervision of professors such as Alain Le Quernec, Jacques Rancière, and Christian Boltanski.\\n\\nMaskiyan\\'s work is characterized by its exploration of the relationship between the individual and society, and the role of art in shaping this relationship. His paintings often depict scenes of everyday life, but with a surreal or dreamlike quality that invites the viewer to question their assumptions about reality. His sculptures and installations are similarly thought-provoking, using unconventional materials and unexpected juxtapositions to challenge our perceptions of the world around us.\\n\\nOne of Maskiyan\\'s most notable works is \"The Wall,\" an installation consisting of thousands of small ceramic tiles arranged in a wall-like formation. Each tile bears an image or text that reflects on themes of identity, memory, and belonging. The work invites viewers to engage with it in various ways, including adding their own images or texts to the wall.\\n\\nAnother significant work is \"The Garden of Displaced Persons,\" an ongoing project that explores the experiences of refugees and displaced persons through art. Maskiyan collaborates with refugees and migrants to create artworks that reflect their stories and experiences, and these works are then exhibited in galleries and public spaces around the world.\\n\\nMaskiyan\\'s work has been shown in numerous group and solo'}]"

To order a Veggie Tender with a medium size and a salad instead of a side dish or drink, you would need to find the menu code for the Veggie Tender with medium size and the separate price for a salad. Unfortunately, this information was not provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your request. However, if you are ordering at the counter, you could ask the cashier for a Veggie Tender with medium size and a salad, and they should be able to give you an accurate price based on their current menu.</p>"
